SP proof of concept userland examples
-------------------------------------

This directory contains a simple fanout server and client for use with the
proof of concept SP implementation at git@github.com:sustrik/linux-2.6.git

To run the demonstration, build the files with 'make' and then start a server,
for example:

  $ ./fanout_server tcp://0.0.0.0:1111

You can then start and stop as many clients as you like:

  $ ./fanout_client tcp://127.0.0.1:1111

The server will send a message each time <ENTER> is pressed.
