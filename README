SP proof of concept userland examples
-------------------------------------

This directory contains examples for use with the proof of concept
SP implementation at git@github.com:sustrik/linux-2.6.git

To run the demonstration, build the files with 'make' first, then start one
of following tests:

PUB/SUB test
------------

First, start the publishing server:

  $ ./pubsub_server tcp://0.0.0.0:1111

You can then start and stop as many clients as you like:

  $ ./pubsub_client tcp://127.0.0.1:1111

The server will send a message each time <ENTER> is pressed. The message gets
distributed to all the clients.

REQ/REP test
------------

First, start the server:

  $ ./reqrep_server tcp://0.0.0.0:1111

You can then start as many clients as you like. Each client sends its process ID
to the server which the send it back the original client:

  $ ./reqrep_client tcp://127.0.0.1:1111

PUSH/PULL test
--------------

First, start the server:

  $ ./pushpull_server tcp://0.0.0.0:1111

You can then start and stop as many clients as you like:

  $ ./pushpull_client tcp://127.0.0.1:1111

The server will send a message each time <ENTER> is pressed. The messages get
load-balanced among individual clients.
